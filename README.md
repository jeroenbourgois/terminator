I decided to switch back to zsh after two years of fish. While I was very happy for the most part, in my company we share a lot of terminal scripts and other stuff wich sometimes just didn't work out of the box with Fish. My new setup is inspired by [termieter]([https://github.com/pierot/termieter).

For those who are interested, the old setup can be found in the `fish` tag of the repo.

My shell environment, the Fish shell

-------

`bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeroenbourgois/terminator/master/install)`
